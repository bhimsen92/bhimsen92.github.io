      <description>Before I write about Rabbitmq, let&amp;rsquo;s briefly talk about what message queues are in the first place. Message Queue is a programming paradigm which is used for inter process communication where proceses are running either on the same machine or on different machines.&#xA;When your design requires loose coupling between components, a part of your solution has a cpu intensive operation which can be delgated to a background process, you have to notify multiple components of a certain event then message queue is the solution that you would like to consider for your project.</description>

      <description>Python is one of my favourite language. It is very intuitive, simple and a powerful language. It&amp;rsquo;s power comes from its ability to give the developers the freedom to manipulate the language at run time. One such ability is how a programmer can intercept the control during class object creation and change its outlook entirely from what programmer intented. This is achieved through a language feature called metaclass.&#xA;metaclass is a class of a class.</description>
