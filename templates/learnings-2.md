I recently left my job—or rather, I was let go. But since I had already decided to leave in a couple of weeks, I’d say it was a mutual parting. You might see it differently, and that’s okay.

Over time, I had grown to dislike the job for various reasons. I didn’t fully understand my dissatisfaction at first, but after leaving, I was able to piece together what went wrong:

### Reasons for Leaving


- The framework they used just didn’t resonate with me. I kept asking myself, “What’s the point? No one uses this, especially the companies I want to work for in the future.”
- I had become seriously lazy.
- New parenthood took a toll on me, making it difficult to concentrate.
- I struggled to understand the product. While I grasped the business side, the product itself remained unclear, which only added to my confusion. Combined with personal issues, this made things even worse.

Surprisingly, I didn’t feel sad when I left. Instead, I felt relieved. I realized I wasn’t the right fit for the company and should have recognized this sooner. However, my lack of experience prevented me from seeing it.

### Solutions

**Lack of Motivation:**
Identify the root cause. If it is related to your professional life, talk to your manager and explain it fully. Be open with the chanlleges you are facing and seek guidance to address them.

**Balancing Parenthood:**
Block time in your calendar to take care of family responsibilities. Communicate this clearly with your team and manager. Don’t overestimate your ability to manage both responsibilities without any issues. Find a way to balance your professional and personal life effectively.

**Product Understanding:**
Take proactive steps to deepen your understanding of the product. Schedule meetings with product owners to gain clarity. If the product remains unclear, consider requesting training or additional resources to bridge the knowledge gap.

**Clear Role and Responsibilities:**
From the beginning, seek a clear understanding of your role and responsibilities. If this clarity is not provided, don’t hesitate to ask your manager for a detailed explanation. Regularly check in with your team lead to ensure your role evolves in alignment with project goals. Advocate for yourself if you need clearer directions or guidance.


### What Works for Me

So, I made a list of what works for me and keeps me productive:

**Productive Environment:**  
I’m more productive in an office setting, where I regularly meet people to discuss things, either in scheduled meetings or during coffee breaks. Building close relationships with colleagues helps me work more effectively.

**Preference for Modern Technology:**  
I don’t want to work in a company where technology is stagnant or processes aren’t followed. I prefer working with modern tech and writing or reviewing technical design documents.

**Clear Role and Responsibilities:**  
If my role isn’t clear, I struggle. I’m more productive and excel when given clear directions, especially at the beginning. Once I’m settled in, I can drive tasks forward independently.

**Structured Approach to Problem Solving:**  
I like to write a solution document before coding, especially if the code touches multiple components. I’d rather have the document reviewed first than the code. I believe this approach speeds things up (because reading text is faster than reading code) and avoids unnecessary back and forth. If this isn’t allowed because it’s seen as slowing things down, I think it will soon lead to trouble, at least for me.

**Honest Team:**  
I prefer working with honest people who understand their roles well. A senior engineer should mentor, and a team lead should guide both the technical and team aspects of a project. Without that, based on my experience, working with people who are only senior or lead in title leads to frustration.

### Embracing Life’s Complexities

Life is complex and confusing: embrace it, don’t fight it.

A week after leaving my job, I started preparing for the job hunt. It was terrifying, to be honest. Where should I start? How many LeetCode questions should I solve? What about system design? Low-level design? How much is enough? With so many resources out there, which ones are the best? Solving a LeetCode hard problem at home is one thing, but doing it in an interview under stress with limited time—how do I simulate that? What if I can’t answer it? What’s next? It was all so confusing, complicated, and scary. I almost fell into depression.

Then I took a step back and thought about my high school and college days. I wasn’t as stressed or scared back then. Why was that? I believe it was because we had clear directions or paths laid out for us. What books to read, when to prepare for tests, and how much to study for each exam—all of this was decided for us. There was no room for ambiguity.

But life doesn’t work that way. If you’re unlucky, you have to deal with this ambiguity yourself. It’s frustrating. Which company should I work for? Will working for this team help my future? Should I work in India or abroad? You age, you get sick, and people you love get sick. There’s so much to handle!

But instead of getting scared and losing hope, I think it’s better to embrace this ambiguity. Create a path for yourself and stick to it. Try things out—if you fail, fail fast. Learn from your mistakes. Practice. Try again. If you fail, repeat the cycle until you succeed. I believe this repetition has a compounding effect. With every attempt, you’re better than before. As software engineers, many of us are fortunate to have the opportunity to go through this cycle.

### Advice

So, my advice to myself and others reading this is: Make a plan, stick to it, and fail fast or succeed.


**If you want to do something, do it:**  
If challenges arise, you can deal with them. If you want to travel, travel. If you want to move abroad, move abroad. But keep doing something.

**Keep solving LeetCode problems every day, even if you have a job:**  
Pick a list, say the top 300 problems, and start solving them. If you can’t solve a problem, read the solution, understand it, and code it. Code it multiple times. This practice has a compounding effect. After a year or two, you’ll be so good at DSA that you won’t have to go through this process again. I now feel confident that I can solve medium-level problems. I can arrive at a solution if I stay calm within an hour. Sure, there’s still room for improvement, but I didn’t have this confidence last year, so it’s progress.

**Keep going through system design case studies multiple times:**  
You’ll learn something new each time you read them.

**Never waste a moment:**  
Either spend your free time with yourself, your family, or doing work that improves your professional life. Don’t waste it doing nothing.

**So, don’t be scared. Keep working and be happy.**
