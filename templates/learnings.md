As a sofware engineer with ten years of experience, I have seen many ups and downs. This has taught me many things both professionally and personally. Here is a summary of those learnings.

<br />

- Follow [Boys Scout Rule](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_08)
   as much as possible.

- Don't make promises but if you do, don't break them.
- Always underestimate and overperform than overesitmate and underform.
