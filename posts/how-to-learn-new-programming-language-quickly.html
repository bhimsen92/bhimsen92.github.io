            Our job requires us to learn new programming languages once in a
            while. Some languages are easy while others have steep learning
            curve. I would have wished if there was a templte for learning
            languages because each language has similar concepts but with
            different syntax. Once you understand what is common between the
            language you know and the language you want to learn, all that is
            left is to master the syntax which comes with some practice. This
            document tries to encapsulate all that for the scala language and
            later use it to learn both Python, Rust and Java.
          </p>

          <p>
            This document expects the reader to know at least one programming
            language and have some idea of what OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
            and Function Programming means.
          </p>

          <p>
            What is a programming language ? Though I donâ€™t know the textbook
            definition, in my opinion a programming language is a system(of
            notations) which has facilities to represent real world entities and
            manipulate them using predefined or custom operations to produce a
            result.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on the above definition, it is very easy to deduce that every
            programming language should have few things or sometime more in
            common. So first we list down all things that are common between
            languages. Later we will diverge based on whether the language is an
            OO(object oriented) or functional language.
          </p>

          <h3>
            If the language supports object oriented programming then it should
            have:
          </h3>

              Multiple Inheritance. [not all languages support this feature]

          <h3>If the language is Functional language:</h3>

          <ol start="14">
            <li>
              Supports functions as first class objects. That is, there is no
              difference between regular values and functions. They can be
              assigned, passed to functions and can be returned from functions.
