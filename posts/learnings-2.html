          <p>
            I recently left my job—or rather, I was let go. But since I had
            already decided to leave in a couple of weeks, I’d say it was a
            mutual parting. You might see it differently, and that’s okay.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, I had grown to dislike the job for various reasons. I
            didn’t fully understand my dissatisfaction at first, but after
            leaving, I was able to piece together what went wrong:
          </p>

          <h3>Reasons for Leaving</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The framework they used just didn’t resonate with me. I kept
              asking myself, “What’s the point? No one uses this, especially the
              companies I want to work for in the future.”
            </li>
            <li>I had become seriously lazy.</li>
            <li>
              New parenthood took a toll on me, making it difficult to
              concentrate.
            </li>
            <li>
              I struggled to understand the product. While I grasped the
              business side, the product itself remained unclear, which only
              added to my confusion. Combined with personal issues, this made
              things even worse.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Surprisingly, I didn’t feel sad when I left. Instead, I felt
            relieved. I realized I wasn’t the right fit for the company and
            should have recognized this sooner. However, my lack of experience
            prevented me from seeing it.
          </p>

          <h3>Solutions</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Lack of Motivation:</strong>
            Identify the root cause. If it is related to your professional life,
            talk to your manager and explain it fully. Be open with the
            chanlleges you are facing and seek guidance to address them.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Balancing Parenthood:</strong>
            Block time in your calendar to take care of family responsibilities.
            Communicate this clearly with your team and manager. Don’t
            overestimate your ability to manage both responsibilities without
            any issues. Find a way to balance your professional and personal
            life effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Product Understanding:</strong>
            Take proactive steps to deepen your understanding of the product.
            Schedule meetings with product owners to gain clarity. If the
            product remains unclear, consider requesting training or additional
            resources to bridge the knowledge gap.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Clear Role and Responsibilities:</strong>
            From the beginning, seek a clear understanding of your role and
            responsibilities. If this clarity is not provided, don’t hesitate to
            ask your manager for a detailed explanation. Regularly check in with
            your team lead to ensure your role evolves in alignment with project
            goals. Advocate for yourself if you need clearer directions or
            guidance.
          </p>

          <h3>What Works for Me</h3>

          <p>So, I made a list of what works for me and keeps me productive:</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Productive Environment:</strong>
            <br />
            I’m more productive in an office setting, where I regularly meet
            people to discuss things, either in scheduled meetings or during
            coffee breaks. Building close relationships with colleagues helps me
            work more effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Preference for Modern Technology:</strong>
            <br />
            I don’t want to work in a company where technology is stagnant or
            processes aren’t followed. I prefer working with modern tech and
            writing or reviewing technical design documents.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Clear Role and Responsibilities:</strong>
            <br />
            If my role isn’t clear, I struggle. While others might figure it
            out, I’m more productive and excel when given clear directions,
            especially at the beginning. Once I’m settled in, I can take
            ownership of a service or project.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structured Approach to Problem Solving:</strong>
            <br />
            I like to write a solution document before coding, especially if the
            code touches multiple components. I’d rather have the document
            reviewed first than the code. I believe this approach speeds things
            up (because reading text is faster than reading code) and avoids
            unnecessary back and forth. If this isn’t allowed because it’s seen
            as slowing things down, I think it will soon lead to trouble, at
            least for me.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Honest Team:</strong>
            <br />
            I prefer working with honest people who understand their roles well.
            A senior engineer should mentor, and a team lead should guide both
            the technical and team aspects of a project. Without that, based on
            my experience, working with people who are only senior or lead in
            title leads to frustration.
          </p>

          <h3>Embracing Life’s Complexities</h3>

          <p>Life is complex and confusing: embrace it, don’t fight it.</p>

          <p>
            A week after leaving my job, I started preparing for the job hunt.
            It was terrifying, to be honest. Where should I start? How many
            LeetCode questions should I solve? What about system design?
            Low-level design? How much is enough? With so many resources out
            there, which ones are the best? Solving a LeetCode hard problem at
            home is one thing, but doing it in an interview under stress with
            limited time—how do I simulate that? What if I can’t answer it?
            What’s next? It was all so confusing, complicated, and scary. I
            almost fell into depression.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then I took a step back and thought about my high school and college
            days. I wasn’t as stressed or scared back then. Why was that? I
            believe it was because we had clear directions or paths laid out for
            us. What books to read, when to prepare for tests, and how much to
            study for each exam—all of this was decided for us. There was no
            room for ambiguity.
          </p>

          <p>
            But life doesn’t work that way. If you’re unlucky, you have to deal
            with this ambiguity yourself. It’s frustrating. Which company should
            I work for? Will working for this team help my future? Should I work
            in India or abroad? You age, you get sick, and people you love get
            sick. There’s so much to handle!
          </p>

          <p>
            But instead of getting scared and losing hope, I think it’s better
            to embrace this ambiguity. Create a path for yourself and stick to
            it. Try things out—if you fail, fail fast. Learn from your mistakes.
            Practice. Try again. If you fail, repeat the cycle until you
            succeed. I believe this repetition has a compounding effect. With
            every attempt, you’re better than before. As software engineers,
            many of us are fortunate to have the opportunity to go through this
            cycle.
          </p>

          <h3>Advice</h3>

          <p>
            So, my advice to myself and others reading this is: Make a plan,
            stick to it, and fail fast or succeed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>If you want to do something, do it:</strong>
            <br />
            If challenges arise, you can deal with them. If you want to travel,
            travel. If you want to move abroad, move abroad. But keep doing
            something.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Keep solving LeetCode problems every day, even if you have a job:
            </strong>
            <br />
            Pick a list, say the top 300 problems, and start solving them. If
            you can’t solve a problem, read the solution, understand it, and
            code it. Code it multiple times. This practice has a compounding
            effect. After a year or two, you’ll be so good at DSA that you won’t
            have to go through this process again. I now feel confident that I
            can solve medium-level problems. I can arrive at a solution if I
            stay calm within an hour. Sure, there’s still room for improvement,
            but I didn’t have this confidence last year, so it’s progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Keep going through system design case studies multiple times:
            </strong>
            <br />
            You’ll learn something new each time you read them.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Never waste a moment:</strong>
            <br />
            Either spend your free time with yourself, your family, or doing
            work that improves your professional life. Don’t waste it doing
            nothing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>So, don’t be scared. Keep working and be happy.</strong>
